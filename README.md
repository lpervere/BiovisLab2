# BiovisLab2
Data parsing and manipulation: Converting Zoo data to a readable format

This is a Processing program. Included is the input file (zoo.csv), the output file created by the program (zoo_out.csv), and the program file itself (BiovisLab2.pde). 

To run this program, open BiovisLab2.pde in Processing. In order for the program to work correctly, the input file titled "zoo.csv" must be in the same directory as the program file. If the program has run successfully, it should create a file called "zoo_out.csv" in the same directory. 

The output file included is the output file generated from the program using the included input file.
